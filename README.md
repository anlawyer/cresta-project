This is the codebase for a demo application, created for the interview process with an interesting startup out of Stanford. 

Here is a link to the live [app](https://anlawyer.github.io/react-frontend-project/) and a link to the [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/BHSqVJ6SIhAbsJkHkQICZgzD/React-Frontend-Wireframe).

I used React and Bulma to build the frontend. It's quite simple for now, but further work might include implementing socket.io and further styling/interaction with colors around the chatboxes. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
